        <h2>My Autobiography</h2>
        <p>My name is John Wesley, and I am a web developer with a passion for creating interactive and user-friendly websites. I started my journey in web development 6 months ago, and since then, I have been continuously learning and improving my skills.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in web development, and contributing to open-source projects. I believe that sharing knowledge and collaborating with others is essential for growth in this field.</p>
